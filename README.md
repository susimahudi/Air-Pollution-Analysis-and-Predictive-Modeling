# Air-Pollution-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modeling
Conducted an in-depth analysis of air pollution using predictive modeling techniques. The project involved several stages including business analysis, data understanding, exploratory data analysis, and building predictive models using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree to identify factors contributing to air pollution. This project was created for the GEMASTIK 2023 competition.

Key Findings: Determined that the PM2.5 parameter has the most significant impact on air pollution levels, as evidenced by comprehensive visualizations.
Challenges: Addressed the complexity of handling various air quality parameters and ensured data consistency for accurate analysis.
Outcomes: Developed predictive models, with the Decision Tree model achieving the highest accuracy in predicting air pollution levels.
Technology / Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.
